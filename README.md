# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a comprehensive and interactive web application that visualizes several classic sorting algorithms. It's built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating a strong understanding of front-end development and fundamental computer science concepts.

## Features

-   **Multiple Algorithms:** Visualize a wide range of algorithms, including:
    -   Logarithmic: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort.
    -   Quadratic: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Gnome Sort, Shaker Sort, Odd-Even Sort.
-   **Interactive Controls:** Users can dynamically adjust array size and visualization speed.
-   **Custom Input:** The application allows users to enter their own custom arrays to test specific cases.
-   **Performance Metrics:** A dedicated statistics panel displays real-time performance data, including comparisons, swaps, and time complexity for each algorithm.
-   **Multi-page Structure:** The project is organized into multiple pages for a professional, cohesive user experience, including a home page, the visualizer itself, and an "algorithms" page with detailed explanations.
